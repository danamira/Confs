<h2>ðŸ’¡ What is this?</h2>
<p>This is a personal repository where I keep the configurations for the tools I use so that I can access them whenever I need.
Adding these to the programs you use might change your previous settings. So make sure to check that you're comfortable with them before importing them.
<br>
These might not be really useful for you as they're chosen based on my personal preference but I try to include a snippet or a preview of the changes they're going to apply so that you'll have a better idea of the reuslt.
